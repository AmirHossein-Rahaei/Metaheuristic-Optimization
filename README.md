Metaheuristic Optimization for Feature Selection

This repository showcases my exploration of metaheuristic optimization techniques for enhancing regression models. I have implemented four prominent algorithms:

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO):

Utilizing the collective intelligence of ant colonies to optimize model parameters, mimicking the foraging behavior of ants.
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):

Inspired by the swarming behavior of birds, PSO optimizes the regression model by iteratively adjusting particle positions in the solution space.
Genetic Algorithm (GA):

Drawing inspiration from the principles of natural selection and genetics, GA evolves a population of potential solutions to find the optimal set of parameters.
Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO):

Modeled after the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves, GWO optimizes the regression model by simulating the collaboration and competition among a pack.
